When a browser loads a webpage, it reads the HTML line by line. If it sees a <script> tag, it pauses everything to download and run the script. This can slow down the page loading.

To fix this, we use async and defer, which are two ways to control how and when a script runs.

Async
Think of async like a kid running to play whenever they get a new toy.
The browser downloads the script in the background while it keeps reading the rest of the HTML.
As soon as the script finishes downloading, it stops everything else to run it immediately.
This can make the page faster, but if you have multiple scripts, they might run in a random order.
Defer
Defer is like a kid waiting to play with all their toys only after finishing homework.
The browser downloads the script in the background, just like async, but it waits until the entire HTML is loaded before running the script.
If there are multiple scripts with defer, they run in the order they appear in the HTML.
